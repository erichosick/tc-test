 * @example
 * /// In a test
 * expect(global.consoleMocks.log).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
 *
 * @note
 * We need access to the consoleMocks but we can't export/import: this file
 * because it is ran jest before each test. The only way to get access to the
 * current consoleMocks is to set them on the global object. We could try to
 * extend NodeEnvironment
 * (see (https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string))
 * but that was getting a bit difficult to code. Just using global for now.
